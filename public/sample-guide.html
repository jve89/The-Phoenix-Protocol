      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The end of a relationship often feels like stepping into fog. You wake up and reach for someone who's no longer there — not just physically, but emotionally. The rituals, the inside jokes, the unconscious way you shaped your day around them… gone. And in that emptiness, your mind clings. It replays every moment, every smile, every mistake — trying to rewrite a story that's already ended.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        But letting go doesn’t mean forgetting or devaluing the connection. It means unhooking your present from a past that can no longer evolve. It’s giving yourself permission to stop obsessing over “what could’ve been” and start asking “what could be next?”
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Mike, a former client, struggled with this after a 5-year relationship. At first, he checked her Instagram daily, hoping for signs of regret. But nothing changed — except his own suffering. The real shift came when he stopped chasing closure and started creating rituals of his own: morning walks without his phone, handwritten letters he never sent, and one brave decision — to stop looking at her updates altogether.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        You don’t need to “move on” today. Just loosen the grip. Create space. And when the weight lifts — even for a second — fill that space with something that belongs only to you.

      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Healing can feel like chaos. Some days you’re fine. Other days, a song, a smell, a random memory drags you under. That’s normal. What matters is having anchors — routines that give your nervous system a chance to calm down, realign, and reset. Here’s one day. One structure. One blueprint. Follow it, modify it, or steal just one idea that feels right today.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Morning:</strong> 5-minute deep breathing — inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Eyes closed. Shoulders dropped.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Check:</strong> Mute or archive chats with your ex. It’s not about erasing — it’s about protecting your peace.</li>
        <li><strong>Affirmation (out loud):</strong> “Their absence doesn’t erase my value.”</li>
        <li><strong>Midday Anchor:</strong> Do one task fully. Fold laundry, answer emails, or organise your desk — but do it with focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Journal: “What did I learn about myself today that I didn’t see before?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        There’s no finish line. Just these little wins. Stack them. Repeat them. One day, you’ll look back and realise your old pain is no longer your daily reality.

      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        When a relationship ends, it’s not just the loss of a person — it’s the loss of the role you played. The version of yourself that existed *within* that relationship. So the real question isn’t “How do I get over them?” — it’s “Who am I without the version of me that needed them?”
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Start small. Ask yourself:
        <em>What did I stop doing just to keep the peace?</em> What hobbies, opinions, habits, or dreams did you set aside to avoid arguments, stay likable, or avoid rocking the boat?
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Now reverse-engineer your way back to those parts:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Revive one playlist that made you feel alive — not them, <strong>you</strong>.</li>
        <li>Write a note to your past self: “I’m sorry I left you behind.”</li>
        <li>Make plans for something your ex would’ve rolled their eyes at.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        You’re not broken. You’re just between chapters. This isn’t the end — it’s the first real moment you get to be fully, unapologetically you.

        Missing someone doesn’t always mean you should go back. It means something mattered deeply — and you’re human enough to feel the loss. That emotion is valid. But now it’s time to ask: what do I want to rebuild — my relationship, or myself?

        The Phoenix Protocol doesn’t push you to "move on" or "get them back." It guides you to heal first, so that whatever comes next — reconciliation or release — is grounded in clarity, not desperation.

        Every ending is also an invitation. Not just to survive, but to evolve. You are not broken — you are between versions. This isn’t about fixing yourself, it’s about discovering who you’re becoming without the weight of who you were trying to be.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Before you reach for closure, or clarity, reach inward. Ask: what kind of person do I want to emerge as — not for anyone else, but for myself? This is the seed of a new identity, and your answers will shape the life that follows.

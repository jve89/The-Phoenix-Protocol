    <p style="font-size:22px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:1rem;text-align:center;">
      Welcome to your Phoenix trial
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:16px;color:#555;line-height:1.4;margin-bottom:2rem;">
      This is one of several curated stories created to guide you after heartbreak. Each stands alone, offering a new perspective and a practical step toward healing.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:16px;color:#555;line-height:1.4;margin-bottom:2.5rem;text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
      Moving on means shifting from “why them” to “what now.”
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:1rem;">
      Turning the Page Without Losing the Lessons
    </p>

    <p>When a relationship ends, it’s natural to feel like the story has ended too. The routines, the conversations, the inside jokes — they made up a whole chapter of your life. And when the chapter closes, you might wonder: was it all a waste? The truth is, no chapter is wasted. Each one carries lessons, and moving on means carrying those lessons without carrying the weight of regret.</p>

    <p>Think about what that relationship taught you. Maybe you learned how deeply you can care. Maybe you learned what boundaries you need next time. Maybe you learned that you’re stronger than you thought. These aren’t losses. They are pieces of wisdom you now own, earned through experience. The key is to claim them without clinging to the person who helped reveal them.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">Step One: Extract the Lesson</p>
    <p>Write down three things the relationship showed you — about love, about yourself, about life. Frame them in positive language. Instead of “I learned I can’t trust people,” write, “I learned I need honesty and consistency.” This subtle shift prevents bitterness from defining the story.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">Step Two: Release the Blame</p>
    <p>It’s tempting to replay what they did wrong — or what you did wrong. But blame keeps you tethered to the past. Acknowledge mistakes, but then reframe them as data. “I ignored my needs for too long.” “They weren’t ready for commitment.” These aren’t judgments — they’re facts that inform your next chapter.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">Step Three: Build a Forward Ritual</p>
    <p>Pick one small daily action that symbolizes moving forward. It might be journaling one line each night about what you’re grateful for. It might be a morning stretch routine, a short walk, or cooking a meal just for yourself. Rituals create momentum. They remind you that life is not defined by what ended, but by what you’re creating now.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">Step Four: Redraw Your Identity</p>
    <p>Relationships can blur identity. You might have defined yourself as someone’s partner, someone’s support system, someone’s “other half.” Now is the moment to redraw those lines. Ask: who am I when no one is watching? What lights me up? What do I want to explore? Write down three words that describe the person you are becoming. Let those words be your compass.</p>

    <p>Moving on doesn’t mean erasing the past. It means refusing to let the past keep writing your future. It means holding the lessons in one hand while opening the other to new experiences. Some days it will feel heavy. Some days it will feel freeing. Both are part of the process. The important thing is that the pen is back in your hand — not theirs.</p>

    <p>When you catch yourself drifting back into “what if” or “if only,” pause and say out loud: “That chapter taught me something, but it’s not my whole story.” This single sentence can stop the spiral and remind you of your agency.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">That was today’s Phoenix Protocol trial story.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;line-height:1.4;">
      If these words gave you clarity, imagine receiving this kind of perspective every single day — guidance designed to help you turn lessons into freedom.

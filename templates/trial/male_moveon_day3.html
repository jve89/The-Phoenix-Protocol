    <h1>Welcome to your Phoenix trial</h1>

    <p>
      This is one of several curated stories designed to support you after heartbreak. Each is stand-alone, offering clarity and tools you can use immediately.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
      Moving on is less about replacing someone — and more about rebuilding yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Redefining Yourself Beyond the Breakup</h2>
    <p>There’s a moment after heartbreak where you look in the mirror and barely recognize yourself. So much of who you were got wrapped around the relationship — your time, your habits, even your sense of identity. When it ends, you’re left asking: “Who am I without her?” The answer isn’t about erasing what happened. It’s about rediscovering who you were before — and deliberately shaping who you want to be now.</p>

    <h2>Step One: Break the Comparison Cycle</h2>
    <p>It’s easy to measure yourself against her new life, or against the version of yourself when you were together. Both comparisons are traps. She is walking her path; you are walking yours. And the man you were back then is not the limit of the man you can become. When you catch yourself comparing, interrupt with: “Her story is hers. Mine is mine.”</p>

    <h2>Step Two: Define Strength on Your Terms</h2>
    <p>For too long, strength has been defined as silence — as pretending you don’t care. But silence doesn’t build you; it isolates you. True strength is discipline. It’s doing the workout even when you don’t feel like it. It’s investing in your growth instead of numbing out. It’s admitting pain but refusing to be ruled by it. Write down three qualities that represent the kind of strength you want to embody going forward.</p>

    <h2>Step Three: Build a Personal Mission</h2>
    <p>A breakup clears space, and space begs to be filled. If you don’t fill it with purpose, old patterns creep back in. Ask yourself: what do I want my life to stand for? It could be building a business, mentoring others, getting fit, traveling, or simply being a reliable man for the people in your life. A mission turns pain into fuel. Without it, you’re just drifting.</p>

    <h2>Step Four: Anchor in Action</h2>
    <p>Vision means nothing without action. Choose one step today that aligns with your mission. If it’s health, cook one clean meal or hit the gym. If it’s growth, pick up a book that challenges you. If it’s connection, call a friend instead of isolating. Each action is a brick in the foundation of the new man you’re becoming.</p>

    <h2>Step Five: Forgive Without Permission</h2>
    <p>Forgiveness isn’t about excusing her or excusing yourself. It’s about cutting the chain that keeps you dragging the past behind you. Say out loud: “I release myself. I release her. I choose peace.” You don’t need her response. Forgiveness is your decision, your freedom.</p>

    <p>Moving on doesn’t mean you never think about her again. It means when you do, it no longer derails you. It means the thoughts come and go without pulling you off course. You stop being a man defined by what ended and start being a man defined by what he builds next.</p>

    <h2>Outro</h2>

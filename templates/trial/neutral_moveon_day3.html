    <h1>Welcome to your Phoenix trial</h1>

    <p>
      This is one of several curated stories created to help you recover after heartbreak. Each story is stand-alone, offering perspective and practice you can use immediately.
    </p>

    <p class="center" style="font-style:italic;">
      Moving on is not forgetting the past — it’s building a life bigger than what ended.
    </p>

    <h2>Choosing Growth Over Ghosts</h2>
    <p>Heartbreak often convinces you that your best days are already behind you. That everything meaningful was tied to someone who’s no longer here. But the truth is that heartbreak can also be the moment life cracks open — showing you paths you never considered before. Moving on doesn’t mean erasing memories. It means refusing to let them define your limits.</p>

    <p><strong>Step One: Shift From Loss to Learning.</strong> Instead of repeating, “I lost them,” try asking, “What did I learn from this?” Maybe you learned resilience. Maybe you learned the kind of communication you truly need. Maybe you discovered you can survive more than you thought possible. These lessons are assets, not chains. Write them down — they’re the blueprint of your next chapter.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Two: Break the “What If” Loop.</strong> The mind loves to replay alternate versions of the story: what if I said this, what if they did that, what if we tried again? These loops feel endless, but they are choices. Each time one begins, stop and say, “That’s the past. I choose now.” This phrase interrupts the loop and reminds you that your life is not behind you — it’s in front of you.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Three: Invest in Future You.</strong> Picture yourself a year from now, healed and thriving. Who are you with? What does your day look like? What fills your time? Now ask: what is one action today that belongs to that version of me? It might be signing up for a class, reconnecting with a hobby, or setting a financial goal. By taking even a small step now, you align with the person you’re becoming instead of the person you lost.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Four: Rebuild Trust With Yourself.</strong> Relationships often end with broken trust — sometimes theirs, sometimes yours. Moving on requires restoring trust inside yourself. Keep one promise to yourself every day, no matter how small. Drink the water. Take the walk. Send the email. Each promise kept proves to your nervous system: I can rely on me. That confidence grows quietly, but steadily, until it becomes unshakable.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Five: Redefine Connection.</strong> Many people stay stuck because they confuse one relationship with all relationships. Just because this bond ended doesn’t mean love itself is gone. Begin expanding your circle of connection: deepen friendships, spend time with family, or volunteer. Love doesn’t only exist romantically — and when you rediscover it in other forms, the emptiness softens.</p>

    <p>Moving on isn’t a finish line you sprint toward. It’s a practice of choosing life over longing, clarity over confusion, and self-respect over regret. Some days will feel heavy; others will feel light. Both are valid. What matters is that you keep choosing forward instead of circling back.</p>

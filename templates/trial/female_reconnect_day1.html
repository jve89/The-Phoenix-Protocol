    <p style="font-size:22px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:1rem;text-align:center;">
      Welcome to Day 1 of your Phoenix trial
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:16px;color:#555;line-height:1.4;margin-bottom:2rem;">
      This is one of three curated stories to help you start moving forward after heartbreak. You’ll also find a small gift attached — something to support you between the words.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:16px;color:#555;line-height:1.4;margin-bottom:2.5rem;text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
      Now, take a breath — and let’s begin.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:1rem;">
      The 73% Rule — Why He’s Still Thinking About You Too
    </p>

    <p>Here’s something you probably didn’t expect: According to a Stanford study on emotional attachment after breakups, 73% of people admit to thinking about their ex at least once a week — even months after the breakup.</p>

    <p>That number isn’t just a statistic. It’s a crack in the illusion that he’s “over it” while you’re still piecing yourself back together. The truth? You’re not the only one replaying moments, wondering what could’ve been, or checking for signs that he might still care.</p>

    <p>Now, does this mean he’s meant for you? Not necessarily. But it does mean this: You’re not crazy. You’re not alone. And your desire to reconnect isn’t some wild fantasy — it’s part of a very human process of unresolved emotional bonds.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">
      You Left an Imprint — And He Feels It Too
    </p>

    <p>We tend to underestimate the emotional residue we leave behind. But emotions don’t just vanish because someone walks away. That pull you still feel? There’s a good chance he feels it too — even if he buries it under distractions, ego, or silence.</p>

    <p>People don’t forget connection. They suppress it, avoid it, or pretend it never mattered. But underneath, those moments — the laughter, the inside jokes, the shared vulnerabilities — they linger. Especially when the bond was real.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">
      What Thinking About You Means — And What It Doesn’t
    </p>

    <p>Thinking about you doesn’t automatically mean he’s ready. It can signal curiosity, regret, relief, nostalgia — or all of the above in rotation. Readiness looks different: fewer defensive reactions, more accountability, and a willingness to have grounded conversations instead of rerunning old arguments.</p>

    <p>If he hasn’t reached out, it’s rarely proof he doesn’t care. More often, it’s fear of being rejected, pride about who moves first, or simple uncertainty about whether the door is still open. None of those are insurmountable — but they do respond best to clarity, not pressure.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">
      So… What Now?
    </p>

    <p>This isn’t a sign to send a midnight text or craft the perfect “Hey stranger…” message. This is a moment to reflect: If reconnecting is something you truly want — not out of panic, but out of grounded clarity — then you get to decide how you’ll show up.</p>

    <p>Not as someone begging to be seen. But as someone who <em>already knows</em> her worth — and is simply offering a second glance at something unfinished.</p>

    <p>Today, just sit with this truth: It’s possible he thinks about you more than he lets on. And that doesn't make you delusional — it makes you intuitive.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">
      A Clean First Reach-Out (If You Choose)
    </p>

    <p>If you do decide to break the silence, keep it simple and pressure-free. Try something like:</p>

    <p><em>“Hey — I was thinking about that day at [specific place/memory] and it genuinely made me smile. Hope you’re doing well.”</em></p>

    <p>No apology tour. No “we need to talk.” No hidden test. You’re offering a moment, not a verdict. If there’s warmth on the other side, it’ll show itself. If there isn’t, you’ll know — without losing self-respect.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">
      The Three Checks Before You Hit Send
    </p>

    <p><strong>1) Intention:</strong> Are you reaching out to get relief — or to offer a genuine, light touch? If it’s relief, wait. If it’s genuine, proceed.</p>
    <p><strong>2) Energy:</strong> Read the message out loud. Does your body feel calm? If you feel shaky or urgent, that’s your sign to pause and regulate first.</p>
    <p><strong>3) Outcome:</strong> Are you okay with any response — including none? If yes, you’re ready. If no, you’re still negotiating with hope.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">
      You’re Not Reaching Back — You’re Rising Up
    </p>

    <p>Before you make any moves, take stock of your energy. Are you reaching out to heal — or to fill a gap? Are you hoping he’ll fix the ache — or are you simply curious about what’s still alive between you?</p>

    <p>There’s no shame in wanting to reconnect. The only danger is abandoning yourself in the process.</p>

    <p>Whatever you choose next — whether it’s reaching out or moving on — let it come from alignment, not emptiness. Let it reflect your strength, not your fear.</p>

    <p>Because you? You’re not just another statistic in his memory. You’re the exception that still lingers.</p>

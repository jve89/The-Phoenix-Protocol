    <h1>Welcome to your Phoenix trial</h1>

    <p>
      Today is about space. Not cosmic miles, but the room you inhabit every day — shelves, drawers, screens, doorways, the routes you walk without thinking. After a breakup, these places carry echoes. A mug becomes a memory. A chair becomes a question. Healing accelerates when you reshape the stage your feelings perform on. You do not have to “get over it” first. Change the space and your nervous system gets the hint: life has moved.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
      Change the room, change the story.
    </p>

    <h2>Mapping the Hotspots</h2>
    <p>
      Start with a quiet scan. Stand in your entryway and let your eyes travel the room. Notice the spots that tug at your attention — the shelf with gifts, the playlist open on your laptop, the empty corner where a bag used to rest. These are hotspots, not because you are weak, but because the brain tags locations to memories. Name three hotspots now. If you like, speak them out loud: “The bedside table. The coffee machine. The phone dock.” Naming turns fog into a map. Maps are navigable.
    </p>

    <h2>Micro-Renovations</h2>
    <p>
      You do not need a weekend or a budget. You need ten minutes and intent. Pick one hotspot. Change one detail. Move the frame to a new wall. Swap the mug you always reached for. Fold the blanket differently and place it on the other side of the couch. Replace a photo with a simple printout of a word you want to live into: “Steady.” “New.” “Enough.” These tiny moves break the invisible loop between object and ache. Your body registers novelty and relaxes a notch.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you can, add scent and light. Crack a window for three minutes. Wipe the surface with something that smells clean to you — citrus, pine, lavender. Turn on a lamp instead of the overhead light. Warm lamps tell the brain it is evening in a safe home. You are training your senses to associate this space with who you are becoming, not who you were with.
    </p>

    <h2>The Drawer Ritual</h2>
    <p>
      Most people have a drawer or a box that functions like a minefield. You go looking for a charger and your hand finds a keepsake. Today, create a Drawer Ritual. Take everything out. Place items into three piles: keep, store, release. “Keep” returns to the drawer, but with intent — only what you use weekly. “Store” goes in a labeled envelope in a closet you rarely open. This is not denial; it is containment. “Release” leaves today. If releasing feels too sharp, picture someone else finding use for it. Release is not theft from your history. It is a gift to your future.
    </p>

    <h2>Rewrite the Route</h2>
    <p>
      Heartbreak is not only in rooms; it hides in routes. You walk past the café you shared, the bench where you argued, the crossing where you last waved goodbye. Tomorrow, alter one route. Take the longer street with the quiet trees. Switch the side of the sidewalk. Pick a different bus stop that adds three minutes and subtracts a ghost. One changed route proves a principle: you are not trapped in the past’s geography. Your feet can learn new paths before your mind fully believes them.
    </p>

    <h2>The Sound Reset</h2>
    <p>
      Playlists hold chapters. They can also end them. Build a short, three-track reset — one grounding song, one song that makes you feel competent, one song that opens your chest a little. Keep it short so you actually press play. Use the reset when you feel the tug to scroll their profile, or when a room suddenly feels loud with memories. Sound is a fast corridor to mood. You are not trying to shut feeling down; you are helping it move through.
    </p>

    <h2>Claiming Surfaces</h2>
    <p>
      Choose one surface to claim as your “next-chapter station.” A small table, a shelf, a windowsill. On it, place three objects that belong squarely to you now. A book you chose for yourself. A small plant. A note you write by hand that starts with “I am…” followed by something true today, not a wish: “I am showing up.” “I am changing small things.” “I am allowed to take up space.” This station becomes a tiny lighthouse inside your home. When the tide of memory rises, you can turn toward it and remember where you are heading.
    </p>

    <h2>Clothing and Signals</h2>
    <p>
      Clothing is a portable room. It holds signals, stories, scents. If a sweater pulls you backward, store it for a season. Choose one outfit that signals present-tense you — not the most expensive, the most honest. Maybe it is simple and clean. Maybe it has a bright element you stopped wearing. Wear it on an ordinary day. Let it mark errands, emails, the bus ride. You are teaching your system that ordinary days can carry new signals too.
    </p>

    <h2>Digital Rooms</h2>
    <p>
      Your phone is a set of rooms: lock screen, home screen, album, chat thread. Give yourself a digital renovation. Change the wallpaper to a color that calms you. Move apps that pull you into rumination off the first screen. Create a new album called “Forward” and drop in three photos you like that have nothing to do with the past — a corner of light on your floor, your shoes after a long walk, a messy page of notes. When the mind reaches for the old thread, you have somewhere else to go.
    </p>

    <h2>Guests and Boundaries</h2>
    <p>
      If a friend comes over and your chest tightens at the thought of explaining, pre-decide a boundary sentence: “I’m rebuilding this space for me right now — can we keep conversation light?” or “I’m okay and I’d rather not rehash details today.” Boundaries protect the renovation. You are not required to give a tour of the construction site while you are still laying the floorboards.
    </p>

    <h2>Evening Closure</h2>
    <p>
      Before bed, close the day with a two-minute check. Stand in the doorway of the room you spent the most time in. Say, “This space served me today.” Turn off one light, smooth one surface, and place your phone outside the bedroom if you can. Sleep is a contractor; it works while you are not looking. Give it a tidy site and it will carry more of the load.
    </p>

    <h2>When the Past Knocks</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes, even after you move the frame, rename the drawer, and reroute your walk, a wave crashes in and you are standing in the old room again. This is not failure. It is weather. In that moment, find something physical and definite: count five square edges in the room, touch the doorframe, drink a glass of water. Remind your senses that you are here, not there. Weather passes. Rooms remain.
    </p>

    <h2>What You Are Building</h2>
    <p>
      You are not erasing a chapter or pretending it did not happen. You are building a home that fits who you are now. When the space changes, your habits change. When habits change, your days change. This is not decoration; it is direction. The smallest shifts add up: a moved mug, a clearer drawer, a different street, a new lamp at dusk. Your body starts trusting that forward is safe. And when your body trusts it, your mind follows with less resistance.
    </p>

    <h2>That was today’s Phoenix Protocol trial story.</h2>

    <p>
      If this message resonated with you, imagine what it feels like to receive this kind of clarity and support every single day — not as a reminder of the past, but as a blueprint for your next chapter.

    <p style="font-size:22px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:1rem;text-align:center;">
      Welcome to Day 1 of your Phoenix trial
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:16px;color:#555;line-height:1.4;margin-bottom:2rem;">
      This is one of three curated stories to help you start moving forward after heartbreak. You’ll also find a small gift attached — something to support you between the words.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:16px;color:#555;line-height:1.4;margin-bottom:2.5rem;text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
      Now, take a breath — and let’s begin.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:1rem;">
      Why Letting Go Feels Impossible (And Why It Isn’t)
    </p>

    <p>You’ve done everything right. You ended it. You blocked his number. You deleted the photos. And yet — somehow — he’s still there. In your head. In your chest. In your habits.</p>

    <p>You don’t want to think about him anymore. But there it is again: the scroll through his old messages. The peek at his profile. The way your mind replays moments you wish you could forget — or change. It’s like he’s haunting you. And you’re tired of it.</p>

    <p>You’re probably asking:</p>
    <p><em>“Why can’t I just let go already?”</em></p>

    <p>Let me tell you something that might surprise you: It’s not because you’re weak. It’s not because you’re still in love. And it’s definitely not because you’re doing anything wrong.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">This Isn’t Obsession. It’s a Bond — And Bonds Don’t Break on Command.</p>

    <p>Your brain formed an emotional attachment. It wrapped parts of your identity around this person — your routines, your validation, even your sense of safety.</p>

    <p>And when that bond breaks, your mind doesn’t just erase it. It tries to maintain it, like muscle memory. So it keeps looping. It checks for signs. It scans for closure. Not because you want him back — but because part of you still thinks connection equals survival.</p>

    <p>That’s what you’re fighting. Not your ex. Not your feelings. You’re fighting the aftershock of attachment.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">You’re Not Missing Him — You’re Missing Certainty.</p>

    <p>Maybe you miss how he looked at you on your good days. Or how you knew where your weekend was headed. Or who you were when you were “his.”</p>

    <p>But if you’re honest, you also remember the confusion. The walking-on-eggshells. The nights you stayed quiet instead of asking for what you needed. The emotional exhaustion that crept in like a second skin.</p>

    <p>You don’t miss <em>him</em>. You miss the illusion of safety. And it's okay to admit that.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">The Truth Is: Letting Go Feels Like Losing Control — Until You Do It.</p>

    <p>It’s terrifying to loosen your grip on something that once grounded you. Even if it hurt. Even if it wasn’t right. Because what’s on the other side of that release? Silence? Loneliness? The unknown?</p>

    <p>Here’s the reframe: Letting go isn’t falling into nothing. It’s <em>returning to yourself</em>.</p>

    <p>It’s remembering who you were before the relationship. It’s rebuilding who you want to become after it.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">Try This Today — The Emotional Unhooking Practice</p>

    <p><strong>1. Notice the impulse.</strong> When your mind reaches for him — to check, to replay, to fantasize — pause. Breathe. Say: “I see what’s happening.”</p>

    <p><strong>2. Interrupt the pattern.</strong> Stand up. Move. Touch something cold. Put on a playlist that makes you feel powerful. Snap out of the loop by anchoring into your body.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Reclaim one thing.</strong> Find something that was yours before him. A book. A scent. A song. A place. Use it today. Let it reconnect you to a version of yourself untouched by him.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Write one sentence.</strong> Just one. “Today, I choose myself.” Put it in your notes. Whisper it in the mirror. Make it yours.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">You’re Not Behind. You’re Rebalancing.</p>

    <p>This isn’t a race. You don’t need to “get over it” by tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Letting go is like unclenching your fists after holding on too tight — painful at first, but freeing.</p>

    <p>Every time you stop yourself from checking, spiraling, or fantasizing, you're rewiring your inner world. Every time you choose stillness over reactivity, you shift the center of gravity — back to you.</p>

    <p>You don’t need to feel better today. You just need to stop handing your power back to someone who’s no longer here.</p>

    <p>That’s what letting go really is. Not forgetting. Not pretending. Just finally choosing peace over permission.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:1.5rem;">That was Day 1 of your Phoenix Protocol trial.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;line-height:1.4;">
      Tomorrow, you’ll receive a completely different story — just as focused, just as real. These trial emails are all handpicked and written to stand on their own.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height:1.4;">And if today’s message helped you even a little… imagine having this kind of clarity every day for the next month.</p>

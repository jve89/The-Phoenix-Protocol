      Welcome to your Phoenix trial
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:16px;color:#555;line-height:1.4;margin-bottom:2rem;">
      This is one of several curated stories designed to support you after heartbreak. Each story stands alone, offering its own perspective and practical steps.

      Reconnection requires readiness — not just desire.

      The Mindset Before Reaching Out
    </p>

    <p>When you think about reconnecting, it’s tempting to focus on the other person — what she might say, how she might react, whether she’ll welcome you back or shut the door. But the real work begins with you. Unless you are clear on your intentions and boundaries, even the best message will collapse under the weight of uncertainty.</p>

    <p><strong>Step One: Examine Your Motive.</strong> Why do you want to reach out? Is it because you regret how things ended? Because you believe you’ve grown and want to show up differently? Or because you simply hate the silence? Write it down in one line. If the answer is tied to loneliness or ego, wait. If it reflects growth and respect, you’re on firmer ground.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Two: Own Your Part.</strong> Every breakup has two sides. Avoiding blame doesn’t mean avoiding accountability. What part did you play in the distance that grew? Was it neglect, miscommunication, pride, or silence? Be specific. You can’t reconnect authentically if you’re not willing to name the ways you contributed. This isn’t about self-punishment. It’s about integrity.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Three: Define Your Boundaries.</strong> Imagine the conversation goes well — what does “success” look like? A coffee? An honest exchange? A second chance? Now imagine it doesn’t go well — what lines won’t you cross? Decide, in advance, how much effort you’ll invest and how you’ll protect your dignity if she declines. Boundaries prevent you from sliding back into patterns that broke things in the first place.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Four: Draft Without Sending.</strong> Write your first message in a neutral space — a notes app, a piece of paper. Keep it short, direct, and free of pressure. Something like: “I’ve been reflecting and would value a short conversation, if you’re open to it.” Notice what this message does: it takes ownership, invites, but doesn’t demand. Then, walk away. Let it sit. Time cools impulse and strengthens intention.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Five: Rehearse Both Outcomes.</strong> Close your eyes. Picture her responding positively. Now picture her ignoring the message completely. Hold both until they feel survivable. This isn’t negativity. It’s preparation. If you can remain steady in either outcome, you’re ready. If one scenario makes you spiral, you still have more grounding work to do.</p>

    <p><strong>Step Six: Build Emotional Insurance.</strong> Before reaching out, line up support. A trusted friend, a coach, a journal practice, even a workout routine. You need somewhere to put the emotions that may flood after sending. Reconnection isn’t a guaranteed success. It’s a test of alignment. Having support ensures you don’t collapse if the result isn’t what you hoped.</p>

    <p>Reconnecting is not about proving you’re worth it. You already are. It’s about offering a bridge and seeing if she chooses to meet you halfway. If she does, the work continues in rebuilding trust. If she doesn’t, you’ve acted with clarity and can step forward knowing you gave it your best.</p>

    <p>Strength lies in being able to reach out without losing yourself in the process. That’s the balance you’re aiming for: courage without desperation, honesty without pressure, openness without self-betrayal.</p>

    <h1>Welcome to your Phoenix trial</h1>

    <p>
      This is one of several curated stories to help you regain balance after heartbreak. Each is stand-alone, offering perspective and practice you can carry with you.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
      Moving on isn’t about what you walk away from — it’s about who you choose to walk toward.
    </p>

    <h2>Becoming the Author of Your Next Chapter</h2>

    <p>When you’ve lost someone important, it’s easy to feel like your life has been reduced to an after-story. As if the best part already happened and everything else is just recovery. But this is a lie heartbreak tells. The truth is that what ended was only one chapter — not the book. The pen is still in your hand, and moving on means daring to write something new instead of rereading what’s already been written.</p>

    <p>One of the most powerful ways to shift forward is to stop framing yourself as the abandoned or the betrayed, and instead begin to see yourself as the chooser. You are not just someone who “lost.” You are someone who gets to decide what happens next. That shift, from passive to active, is where strength is reborn.</p>

    <h2>Step One: Reclaim Your Language</h2>
    <p>Pay attention to the words you use about the breakup. “He left me.” “I can’t let go.” “I’m broken.” These phrases make you a character in someone else’s script. Try instead: “That relationship ended.” “I’m learning to let go.” “I am healing.” Subtle shifts in language reshape the way your brain codes the experience — from victimhood to agency.</p>

    <h2>Step Two: Build a Self-Contract</h2>
    <p>Write down three promises to yourself that have nothing to do with him. For example: “I will not check his profile.” “I will invest time in my friendships.” “I will try one new thing each week.” This contract becomes your private compass. Keep it visible — taped to a mirror, saved in your notes — as a reminder that moving on is not abstract, it’s a series of choices you honor daily.</p>

    <h2>Step Three: Create a Vision of “After”</h2>
    <p>Close your eyes and imagine your life one year from now if you commit to moving forward. What does your space look like? Who surrounds you? How do you spend your mornings? Capture the image in as much detail as possible, then write a short description of it. This isn’t fantasy; it’s a blueprint. The clearer you see it, the easier it becomes to step into it.</p>

    <h2>Step Four: Act Into the Future</h2>
    <p>Take one small step today that belongs to that vision. If you see yourself strong, go to the gym. If you see yourself creative, open a notebook. If you see yourself independent, book a solo outing. Don’t wait to feel ready. Readiness comes from action, not before it.</p>

    <p>Every time you do something that aligns with your future self, you weaken the pull of the past. You stop being someone orbiting around what was, and start becoming someone magnetized by what could be. And that is the essence of moving on — not forgetting, not erasing, but redirecting your energy toward a life you want to inhabit.</p>

    <h2>Outro</h2>
    <p>That concludes your Phoenix Protocol trial. Over these messages, you’ve seen how powerful it can be to receive focused, compassionate guidance right in your inbox. Each story stood on its own — yet together they show what becomes possible when you stop trying to heal alone. If this resonated with you, know that the full Phoenix Protocol delivers fresh stories every single day, each one designed to carry you forward step by step. The next chapter is waiting for you.</p>

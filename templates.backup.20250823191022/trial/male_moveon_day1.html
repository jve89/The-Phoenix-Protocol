    <h1>Welcome to Day 1 of your Phoenix trial</h1>

    <p>
      This is one of three curated stories to help you start moving forward after heartbreak. You’ll also find a small gift attached — something to support you between the words.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
      Now, take a breath — and let’s begin.
    </p>

    <h2>The Dopamine Trap — Why Your Brain Wants Her Back Even When You Don’t</h2>

    <p>You ended it for a reason. You remember the arguments, the frustration, the way things stopped feeling right. And yet, when you’re alone — maybe scrolling through your phone at night — her face pops into your head. You feel that little tug. Not enough to want her back… but enough to keep you stuck.</p>

    <p>Here’s the truth: that pull isn’t love. It’s chemistry. And once you understand the science, you’ll stop mistaking it for something worth holding on to.</p>

    <h2>Breakups and Brain Chemistry</h2>

    <p>When you were with her, your brain got used to little “reward hits.” A smile from her. A touch. A message that lit up your screen. Every one of those moments released <strong>dopamine</strong> — your brain’s feel-good chemical.</p>

    <p>Over time, your brain built a pattern: <em>her = reward.</em> When the relationship ended, the pattern didn’t. Your brain is still looking for those hits, like a gambler who knows the slot machine is broken but still pulls the lever “just in case.”</p>

    <h2>The Withdrawal Effect</h2>

    <p>Neurologists have compared heartbreak to withdrawal from addictive substances — and they’re not exaggerating. MRI scans show that after a breakup, the same brain regions that light up in drug cravings also fire when you think about your ex.</p>

    <p>This isn’t because you need <em>her</em>. It’s because your brain is wired to chase the <em>chemical high</em> it associates with her.</p>

    <h2>Why Men Feel This Differently</h2>

    <p>Research suggests men often show a delayed emotional response after breakups. You might look fine on the outside — working out, meeting friends, getting on with life — but in quiet moments, the withdrawal creeps in.</p>

    <p>For men, pride often masks pain. Instead of talking about it or processing it directly, the brain tries to “solve” the discomfort by pushing you back toward the source. It’s not romance. It’s your nervous system looking for its fix.</p>

    <h2>The Dangerous Loop</h2>

    <p>If you answer the brain’s craving by checking her social media, re-reading old texts, or worse — reaching out “just to see how she’s doing” — you give it another dopamine hit.</p>

    <p>That hit feels good in the moment. But it reinforces the craving, making it harder to fully move on. It’s the same cycle that keeps gamblers at the table or smokers reaching for “just one” cigarette.</p>

    <h2>Breaking the Pattern</h2>

    <p><strong>1. Starve the Trigger.</strong> Delete her from your phone. Unfollow or mute on social. Every reminder is a spark for the craving.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Redirect the Hit.</strong> Replace the dopamine source with something that gives you an equal or greater rush: workouts, cold exposure, competition, focused learning.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Track Your Wins.</strong> Every day you resist checking in is a victory. Keep score — it turns recovery into a challenge instead of a chore.</p>

    <h2>Why This Works</h2>

    <p>Within about 21 days, most men report a drop in the intensity of their cravings. By 90 days, the old chemical loop is largely broken — replaced by new, healthier reward systems.</p>

    <p>The point isn’t to erase her from memory. It’s to rewire your brain so thoughts of her carry no charge. No rush. No pull. Just… neutral.</p>

    <h2>Remember This</h2>

    <p>Missing her doesn’t always mean wanting her back. Sometimes it’s just the echo of a chemical pattern that’s past its expiration date.</p>

    <p>And once you see the game your brain is playing, you can choose not to play along.</p>

    <p>That’s the <em>dopamine trap</em> — and now, you’re already halfway out of it.</p>

    <h2>That was Day 1 of your Phoenix Protocol trial.</h2>
